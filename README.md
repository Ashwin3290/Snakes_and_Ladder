# Snakes_and_Ladder
 
Introduction
---
This project is my game of snakes and ladder which everyone has played in the childhood. I made the game on a self imposed rule of not using any resources available on the internet be it code snippets or images. Hence every bit of code and graphics is original.

Requirements
---
The projects requires Python v3.0+ to run along with the modules Numpy and Pygame

Numpy
```
pip intall numpy
```
Pygame
```
pip install pygame
```

Steps to run
---
* Make sure the scripts folder and Snakes and ladder.py are in the same directory
* Run the Snakes and ladder.py and u are ready to go.
